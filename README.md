# R-Data-Cleaning and Visualization

## About the Project
This repository is to showcase my project of data cleaning and data visualization using R. It uses R with packages of **GGPLOT2** and **tidyverse** for data visualization and pipeline, respectively.

## Getting Started
These are the steps to install and download R and RStudio.
  1. Get R (for free) at https://cran.r-project.org/
  2. Choose which package to install for your operating device (Mac, Windows, Linux)
  3. Download RStudio (for free) at https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/
  4. To download libraries (of GGPLOT2 and tidyverse) follow the steps at https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/

## Usage
In the R code, it shows data cleaning, creating & deleting columns, and data visualization. These examples are quite useful when dealing with large, messy data. Most of the data cleaning is to reduce redunancy and to make the data easier for data manipulation. 

In this repository, the CSV file used is from Kraggle. The dataset is about student's study performance. I have changed some of the data to showcase data cleaning. If interested, the original dataset is at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams 

GGPLOT2 is useful to visualize and create complex plots. Below is an example of a ggplot that I have created in the rmd.
